# AI-Driven Smart Agriculture System

## Overview
This project is a prototype of an AI-driven smart agriculture system that helps farmers with:
- Crop yield prediction
- Crop disease detection
- Advisory support for better decision-making

## Features
- Crop Yield Prediction using weather and soil parameters
- Crop Disease Detection using image-based analysis
- Farmer-friendly web interface
- Modular and scalable architecture

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js (React), TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- AI Models (Proposed): Random Forest, CNN
- Backend (Planned): Python, Flask

## Prototype Status
This repository contains a frontend prototype demonstrating the system workflow.
AI models will be integrated in the backend in future phases.

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
